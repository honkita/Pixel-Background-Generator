# Pixel-Background-Generator

## About

This is an ongoing work in progress application that can generate dithered pixel backgrounds. I created this originally to make a pixel background for my website. Below is an example of a photo I created for my site.

## What additional features can you expect from this in the foreseeable future?

The last feature being added is the name changing functionality.

## How many colours does this support and what customizations can be done??

As of the most recent update, this application allows for additional or fewer colours to be added to the gradient. In addition to this, the dithering density (primary, secondary, and tertiary) levels can all be adjusted within the GUI. The application can support modifying the length and width of the image to a minimum of 100px x 100px to 2000px x 2000px.
